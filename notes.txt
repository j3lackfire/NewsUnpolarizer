An example for this would be like this, sentence is:
IPL co-director David Laitin
The result generated from stanford NLP would be
subject: 'David Laitin',
relation: 'is',
object: 'IPL',
Which is just wrong!

The example for this would be:
subject: 'Fails',
relation: 'integration broadly in',
object: 'France',
relationSpan: [ 35, 36 ],
Which, the relation is 3 character long, but only generate 1 span

Given to same sentences back to back in a same paragraph:
    They join previous waves of muslim immigrants , many of whom who are not integrating well.
    They join previous waves of muslim immigrants , many of whom who are not integrating well.

The first on return:
    subject: 'They',
    relation: 'join many',
    object: 'previous waves of muslim immigrants',

While the second one, missing the many (????)
    subject: 'They',
    relation: 'join',
    object: 'previous waves of muslim immigrants'
